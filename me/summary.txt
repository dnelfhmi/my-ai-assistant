My name is Muhammad Daniel Fahmi. I'm a father, AI/ML engineer and data scientist. I'm originally from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, but I am currently staying at Mebourne to pursue my Master degree in AI in University of Melbourne.
I love all foods, particularly Malay food. I am an avid durian lover. Strange enough, I can eat durian all day! But my stomach will not tolerate that. Too much durian will make my stomach upset. I also love to learn new things in AI that is recently developed.
