## Projects

### Smart Agentic Ticketing System  
**AI Engineer** ‚Äî *June 2025 ‚Äì July 2025*
- Designed and implemented a modular agentic support ticket workflow for intelligent triage and resolution, initially using n8n low-code platform then re-engineered with FastAPI and Pydantic for scalable API routing and robust data validation.
- Built a StateGraph pipeline with LangGraph and LangChain to process incoming tickets via webhook, enrich context with OpenAI Embeddings and Pinecone Vector Store, and maintain conversation history with SQLite.
- Developed an autonomous AI agent to classify sentiment, urgency, and topic, dynamically determining next actions such as auto-reply, escalation, or human review.
- Integrated tools and APIs including vector similarity search and memory management to enhance knowledge augmentation and response relevance.
- Validated endpoints using Postman and implemented unit and integration tests with pytest as part of CI/CD.

### Memory-Efficient Multi-Stage Fact-Checking System  
**NLP Engineer & System Architect** ‚Äî *March 2024 ‚Äì May 2024*
- Architected an end-to-end multi-stage RAG pipeline for large-scale claim verification, combining data ingestion, chunking, dual encoder retrieval, cross-encoder reranking, and in-context LLM reasoning.
- Developed a VRAM-efficient streaming dual encoder retriever to enable large-scale passage retrieval without heavy vector indexing, reducing peak memory usage for large corpora.
- Integrated cross-encoder reranking to boost evidence retrieval precision by over 20% compared to baseline dense retrievers.
- Demonstrated practical skills in building scalable RAG pipelines and LLM prompt workflows.

### Big Data Analytics on Cloud: Traffic, Weather and Income Analysis  
**Backend Engineer** ‚Äî *Jan 2024 ‚Äì May 2024*
- Analyzed relationships between traffic accidents, weather, and income using real-time data collection and cloud computing.
- Built data ingestion pipelines using Kafka, ElasticSearch, and Kibana for scalable storage, querying, and visualization.
- Deployed the system with Melbourne Research Cloud, Kubernetes, and Fission for serverless functions.
- Implemented autoscaling and batch processing for improved reliability and throughput.
